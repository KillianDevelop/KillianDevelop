- 👋 Hi, I’m @KillianDevelop
- 👀 I'm interested in back-end/front-end development and hardware.
- 🌱 I learn a lot of things in my training and try to use them in my projects.
- 💻 I created this git to share my personal projects, if you have any suggestions/comments on my code I will be happy to discuss.
- 💞️ I am available if you want to collaborate on a project.
- 📫 You can contact me at killian.nadal@gmail.com
